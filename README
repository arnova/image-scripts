Description
-----------
These scripts allow you to backup (and restore) your computer's filesystems
using partclone (default), partimage, or fsarchiver. Furthermore it
backups/restores bootloaders, partition tables, etc. This includes GPT and
(U)EFI enabled systems. The script features native SMB filesystem support
allowing you to directly backup/restore from an SMB network share.

Requirements
------------
- partclone (or partimage or fsarchiver)
- smbfs (if SMB network support is required)
- (Default) system binaries like sfdisk/fdisk/dd
- sgdisk/gdisk (when GPT support is required)
- Bootable Linux (Rescue) CD. I personally recommend "SystemRescueCD" although
  others should work as well.
- (root) POSIX shell

Usage
-----
Use "restore-image.sh --help" or "backup-image.sh" for info on usage.
